# ðŸ“Š Sports BI Project: A Data Analysis Case Study

## Executive Summary
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Sporty Group's business performance, offering **data-driven insights** to enhance core operations and inform strategic decisions. By building a complete **BI pipeline**, a simulated dataset was generated and loaded into a MySQL database via an automated ETL process. This data was then analyzed using **SQL**, revealing key performance indicators (KPIs), critical user behavior patterns, and the results of a simulated A/B test. The final insights were compiled into an interactive **Metabase dashboard** and this report, serving as a valuable tool for stakeholders to quickly assess business health and capitalize on new opportunities.

## ðŸš€ Project Methodology

### 1. Data Generation & ETL
- **Description:** A realistic, simulated dataset of sports betting activity was created with 500,000 rows. A Python-based ETL pipeline was then developed to automatically load this data into a MySQL database, mimicking a real-world production environment.
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, MySQL Connector

### 2. Data Analysis (SQL)
- **Description:** Complex SQL queries were used to extract meaningful insights and address critical business questions.
